Though process: ```We'll use greedy to find the shortest path ```

Steps: 
* Create a priority queue of min heap so that the one having the shortest distance would be in front
* Create a dist array and initialize it with infinity and assign the dist[src] = 0
* Now push the source into the priority queue
* Run until queue will not become empty
* Pop out the front element and traverse for all adjacent nodes, if any of them is eligible to update then update dist array and push that node along with its distance from source into the priority queue

Imp Note: 

While doing this whole thing, you'll find out that sometime you'll have same distance in your priorrity queue more than once, so why we the same node with different distances is in the priority queue, the answer is that while doing this process whenever we'll find out a node having less dist than the already present in the dist array so we'll update it in our queue, but if at some point we'd find out that the same node is getting updated because we've found a path with less distance then the previous then we'll also update it in our queue, and the good thing is that, always that one would be used for the next process which has the least weight among all the pushed ones because this is priority queue and we're using greedy.

Here we can see that the node 5 is inserted two times, i.e (5, 5) and (7, 5) but only (5, 5) will be used from pri. queue because it has the shortest dist from source i.e 5 and the other one has distance 7.
You can also ommit (7, 5), to do that you have to use set data structure instead of a priority queue i.e ```set<pair<int, int>>``` but deleletion doesn't will make much of a difference and priority queue is easier to implement 


## Time and Space complexity

* Time complexity would be ```O((N+E) + log n)```, O(N+E) for the traversing the adjacency list and logn for the priority queue
* Space complexity: Apart from the adjacency list we'd have ``` O(N) + O(N)```, O(N) for the distance array and O(N) for the priority queue.

```java

class Solution {
    //Function to find the shortest distance of all the vertices
    //from the source vertex S.
    public static class Pair implements Comparable <Pair> {
        int vertex;
        int weight;
        int acquiringVertex;
        
        Pair(int vertex, int acquiringVertex, int weight) {
            this.vertex = vertex;
            this.acquiringVertex = acquiringVertex;
            this.weight = weight;
            
        }
        public int compareTo(Pair o) {
            return this.weight - o.weight;
        }
    }
    static int[] dijkstra(int V, ArrayList<ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>> adj, int S) {
        // Write your code here
        PriorityQueue<Pair> pq = new PriorityQueue<Pair>();
        int[] path = new int[V];
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[V];
        pq.add(new Pair(S,0,0));
        while(pq.size()>0){
            Pair rem = pq.remove();
            if(visited[rem.vertex] == true) continue;
            
            visited[rem.vertex] = true;
            path[rem.vertex] = rem.weight;
            for(ArrayList<Integer> e: adj.get(rem.vertex)){
                if((visited[e.get(0)]) == false){
                    pq.add(new Pair(e.get(0),rem.vertex,e.get(1)+rem.weight));
                }
            }
            
            
        }
        return path;
    }
}


```
