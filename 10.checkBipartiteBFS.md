Thought Process: ```If the graph doesn't have odd length cycle then it is bipartite graph```  or you can say that  ```if the graph have odd length cycle it will never be bipartite```


Steps:

* Take an array of size equal to total no. of nodes and assign it with -1, i.e all the nodes are non coloured yet
* consider 0 and 1 as two colors, and -1 as non -coloured
* initialize the first node with any color
* Traverse the graph using BFS method
* if any of the component of graph returns false then ans will be No
* If a node is not coloured, color all the adjacent nodes of a node with the opposite color of its parent
* If a node is coloured then check whether the color is same as the color of parent or not
* If the color of adjacent node is same as parent then return false.

The above graph is not bipartite because we can't color it using two different colors, the reason is that the cycle is of odd length


## Time complexity and space complexity
* Time complexity would be ```O(N+E)```
* Space complexity would be ```O(N+E) + O(N) + O(N)``` for adjacency list, queue, color array

## 0 Based Indexing
```java
class Solution {
    boolean check(int idx, int[] color, int[][] graph){
       Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList();
        q.add(idx);
        color[idx] = -1;
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            Integer node = q.poll();
             for(Integer it: graph[node]){
                 if(color[it] == -1){
                     color [it] = 1- color[node];
                     q.add(it);
                 }
                 else if(color[it] == color[node]) return false;
             }
        }
        return true;
    }
    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        int[] color = new int[graph.length];
        Arrays.fill(color,-1);
        
        
        for(int i = 0; i< graph.length ; i++){
            if(color[i] == -1){
                if(check(i, color, graph) == false ) return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
        
        
        
    }
}
```
