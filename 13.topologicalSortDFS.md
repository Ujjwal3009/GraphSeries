Topological sorting is only possible in DAG i.e directed acyclic graph
* It is not possible in undirected graph, because if there is an edge between 1 and 2, you can't say that 1 should come before 2 or 2 should come before 1
* It is also not possible in directed cyclic graph because

because here you can see that this is directed cyclic graph and we cant say that 2 should come before 3 and 2 sould come before 4 also 4 should come before 2, there is a contardiction, that is why topo sort is used only for DAG

We'd just push the node whose dfs call is over into the stack after marking it as visited, and at last just pop all the elements of the stack and print it.

# Time complexity and space complexity
* Time complexity would be ```O(N+E)``` as this is using simple DFS
* space complexity would be ```O(N+E) + O(N) + O(N) + O(N)``` for adjacency list, vis array, for stack and for DFS call.

## 0 Based Indexing
```java
class Solution {
    static void findTopoSort(int node, int vis[], ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, Stack<Integer> st) {
        vis[node] = 1; 
        for(Integer it: adj.get(node)) {
            if(vis[it] == 0) {
                findTopoSort(it, vis, adj, st); 
            } 
        }
        st.push(node); 
    }
    static int[] topoSort(int N, ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj) {
        Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<Integer>(); 
        int vis[] = new int[N]; 
        
        for(int i = 0;i<N;i++) {
            if(vis[i] == 0) {
                findTopoSort(i, vis, adj, st);
            }
        }
        
        int topo[] = new int[N];
        int ind = 0; 
        while(!st.isEmpty()) {
            topo[ind++] = st.pop();
        }
        // for(int i = 0;i<N;i++) System.out.println(topo[i] + " "); 
        return topo; 
    }
}
```
