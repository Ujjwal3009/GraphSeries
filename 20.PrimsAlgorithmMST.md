This would be the MST for the above graph

## Steps:
* Start from the first node

* Find out the minimum edge attach to this edge

* Then in the next step find out all the adjacent nodes attached to the nodes included in the mst, so these marked edges are the attached adjacent edges, now find the min. among them

* and then choose the one with the least edge weight

* Repeat this process until total no of edges in your mst will become n-1, that is when all nodes will be connected

## Let us look at one  more example for better understanding:

PIck the starting node

![Screenshot from 2021-09-01 13-48-57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42698268/131637412-344bb9ea-dd5d-48c4-84be-5734276e5332.png)
Now we can see that this node 2---4 has least weight but we can't pick it as it is creating a cycle, and there can't be a cycle in MST, because the definition itself says that this is a spanning tree, so a tree cannot have a cycle.


So this one will be picked:

below would be the final MST of the given graph:

##  Steps to implement this algorithm:
 * Create 3 arrays of size equal to total no. of vertices i.e n
     * key array of type int, initialized with infinity and source initializd with 0
     * MST array of type bool, initialized with false
     * parent array of type int initialized with -1

1. First of all we'll find out the index from key array having minimum key value, ans that would be the source, in our case it is 0th index
2. The moment you'll get the minimum possible key value, mark it as true in mst
3. check all it's adjacent nodes 
4. and if that node is not marked in mst then update it's weight in key and in the parent array assign the parent name
5. Like here we'll add 0 in mst, then will got to all it's adjacent node, first is 1, 1 is not marked in mst so assign weight in key i.e 2 and assign parent, the parent of 1 is 0 so assign it in parent array, but right now don't include it in your mst.

6. Do this for all adjacent node
7. After doing for all adjacent nodes, find the one having the minimum weight from the key array and mark it as true in mst
8. Now find the adjacent nodes and again store their weight (if it is not include in mst) in key and parent in parent array
9. Then find out the minimum among the key array(the one which is not included in mst) and add it in mst by marking that element in mst array as true.
10. You have to stop when you'll find out that the all adjacnet nodes of the next node is already added in mst.
11. Now you just need to print the parent array as like this as parent of 0 is no one, parent of 1 is 0, parent of 3 is 0, and parent of 4 is 1.

## Bruteforce implementation

```java

class Pair implements Comparable<Pair>{
    int v;
    int av;
    int wt;
    Pair(int v, int av, int wt){
        this.v = v;
        this.av = av;
        this.wt = wt;
    }
    public int compareTo(Pair o){
        return (this.wt- o.wt);
    }
    
}
class Solution
{
    //Function to find sum of weights of edges of the Minimum Spanning Tree.
    static int spanningTree(int V, ArrayList<ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>> adj) 
    {
        PriorityQueue<Pair> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[V];
        int sum = 0;
        //---------------------
        pq.add(new Pair(0,-1,0));
        //----------------------
       
        while(pq.size()>0){
            Pair rem = pq.remove();// remove
            
            if(visited[rem.v] == true) continue;
            visited[rem.v] = true; // mark
            
            sum += rem.wt;// work
            ///add neighbours
            for(ArrayList<Integer> e: adj.get(rem.v)){
                if(visited[e.get(0)] == false){
                    pq.add(new Pair(e.get(0), rem.v, e.get(1)));
                    
                }
            }
            
            
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
